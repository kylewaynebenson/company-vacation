###Lyrics

Life~ older with each 9-5
Time~ by grace I am still alive 
Hashtag blessed~ today this feeling is new. 
Is it God~ or the taste of this Mountain Dew?

Average, Impressive by low standards
Nothing proved, mostly meandered
A good neighbor, bad lover

Never bowled above 160, 
This song never got discovered,
And the girls always wanted my brother

Old~ I'm losing that youthful zest
Bald~ Swapping hair on my head for my chest
Sweaty palms~ at least some things stay the same
Redeemed~ by my limited internet fame.

Jared how many times have we been to taco bell? 
Self image never improved by a corn shell,
How many bands have we started that failed?
On my grave: five foot ten, often emailed.

Average, Impressive by low standards
Nothing proved, mostly meandered
A good neighbor, bad lover

Never bowled above 160, 
This song never got discovered,
And the girls always wanted my brother

###Expectations Pt 1
You gave me a pair of cleats when I asked for
a pair of dancing shoes birthday age four.
You smiled as you promised a pitcher I'd be
for the school team like you and your father before.

You made me your little sweet pitcher,
cause you thought that the world could use more of those.
But I longed for the shoes of a dancer,
as you told me that only a fool wears those clothes.

My hands became callused like leather
familiar like sweat on your brow
Just like you old bastard
Canâ€™t you run a little faster?
with that rugged behavior
Spit and swear and savor

You made me your little sweet pitcher,
cause you thought that the world could use more of those.
But I longed for approval of myself,
as your life taught me only a fool wears those clothes.

Now I dress in patterns I defined
Still expectations with me all the time
Wisdom wears not just a robe of white
I am my father and that is fine

Nor evil black burly bands 
nor people as simple as they seem

I am my father

###Expectations Pt 2
I'll place a bet on Job, that he does whatever is good for himself.
I'll place a bet on Job, that he breaks conventions as someone who asks for help.
To sleep without guilt, or cry as you feel, what a dream to believe in a life where you've done your fill.
Hold your tongue, judge and then shun, rescue souls don't lose one and then maybe a heaven.

I'm starting to see that Hope, is really simple when I forget God and Hell.
And calling the bets all off, that have been made without my consent.

I'm howling at the moon for an eternity with you
Lord God of the middle class, I am exhausted
In my dreams I am drowning.
Save me from myself, I am frail and this feel pointless

And hope
is placin a bet on Job

###Expectations Pt 3
I caused the weight carried on you, pain folded in your freckled skin
Both brown eyes soft from tears and  sleep you quoted Huckleberry Finn
'All right, then, I will go to hell, my Lord is worthy that complaint', 
He is my drug, you are my pain.

Hand written inabilities retaining when your lover leaves
Mornings, before the daylight, Stepping out into the throws
Of a love's last moment, affections you cannot believe
You're my delight my enemy, my delight my enemy

Did you expect my constant love or see the coming of this day
I hope to be what you dreamed up, even if that man is a shame
I am consumed by your notions, I cannot choose I cannot blame
I am the prism you shine through, I am your light I am your frame

###Expectations Pt 4
A picture of us three,
On that first road trip
I miss seeing my dog
Visuals of each memory
Forgetting scents and sounds

Hell I still have her things
stuffed in the crawl space
Our phone plan in my name
She moved to Saratoga Springs
and some how I feel to blame

Very many men have expected more than I of you
Very many times when I put aside what I thought I knew

I wish we could talk about it
I was proud,

But there, that's the problem my heart
prone to nostalgia
locked down to a fragile memory
Before that fight we had in Georgia.

With someone new I'll lose that portion of life I had with you.
And my greatest fear is all I'm too late to start a new

Sitting in my living room a small bed I see each morning,
Remembering his scent, and the form, and feeling out my dreaming
But I don't blame you,
for taking off, I was proud

And there that's the problem my love
prone to forgive you
locked down to a fragile memory
before you took my dog and left me

###Expectations Pt 5
Would I still call it truth if
by ritual I can't love you? My
life would come to a dull standstill
under the guise of a bitter pill

But the sacrament and saints I still call my own
And I pray to that same God pictured high on a thrown
Visions of the holy, all more deserving
Of that lauded bosom burning

Oh, ahhhhhhhhh will I go to hell?

Am I worthy, God, your attention?
When judged, am I too lowly to be mentioned?
Am I worthy, God, disapproving?
Are my questions to Your amusing?

Oh, ahhhhhhhhh will I go to hell?

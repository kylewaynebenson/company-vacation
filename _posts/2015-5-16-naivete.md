###Lyrics

My only hope is to find a girl, most likely named Megan  
Who has wonderful, unmentionable, naivete  
Will be impressed by the full pretentious way  
I vomit everything I'm feeling on this stage  

When I became quasi Orwellian  
Dystopian narratives tinted everything  
I was wildly enthusiastic  
Corrupt felt better, than perfect did to me  

Oh big brother writing all my scenes  
Find my other, you know what I need  
Affectations, similarities  
Are sounding better than the real world does to me  

Oh big brother writing all my scenes  
Find my other, you know what I need

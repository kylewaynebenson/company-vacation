<h2>title: Youthful Zest</h2>

<h3>Lyrics</h3>

<p>Life~ older with each 9-5
Time~ by grace I am still alive
Hashtag blessed~ today this feeling is new.
Is it God~ or the taste of this Mountain Dew?</p>

<p>Average, Impressive by low standards
Nothing proved, mostly meandered
A good neighbor, bad lover</p>

<p>Never bowled above 160,
This song never got discovered,
And the girls always wanted my brother</p>

<p>Old~ I&rsquo;m losing that youthful zest
Bald~ Swapping hair on my head for my chest
Sweaty palms~ at least some things stay the same
Redeemed~ by my limited internet fame.</p>

<p>Jared how many times have we been to taco bell?
Self image never improved by a corn shell,
How many bands have we started that failed?
On my grave: five foot ten, often emailed.</p>

<p>Average, Impressive by low standards
Nothing proved, mostly meandered
A good neighbor, bad lover</p>

<p>Never bowled above 160,
This song never got discovered,
And the girls always wanted my brother</p>

<h3>Demos</h3>

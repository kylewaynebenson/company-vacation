title: Who Has Time

###Lyrics

Wild fits of depression,
Add that one day to hypertension,
I should take that paid time off

Maybe join a gym,
take up a hobby,
Buy new clothes that fit me right

I don't need a lover
who has time for that
I don't have feelings
Never can love enough
Who has time
Who has time

But I'm toward the future
Life always seems to get better,
When you're white and middle class
401k with Match
All my premium's paid
My yoga instructor helps me breath

I don't need a lover
But I need people
Women scare me
Life wasn't meant for that
Who has time for that
Who has time for that

One day I'll find a lover
We'll sleep in different beds
Split our money
All my expectations met
Sounds perfect
Is that sexist?

###Lyrics

<span class="tabs">A D6sus2 F7 E</span>

Wild fits of depression,
Add that one day to hypertension,
I should take that paid time off

Maybe join a gym,
take up a hobby,
Buy new clothes that fit me right

<span class="tabs">A D A F#m</span>

I don't need a lover
who has time for that
I don't have feelings
Never can love enough

<span class="tabs">D7 C#m Bm A</span>

Who has time  
Who has time  

<span class="tabs">A D6sus2 F7 E</span>

But I'm toward the future
Life always seems to get better,
When you're white and middle class
401k with Match
All my premium's paid
My yoga instructor helps me breath

<span class="tabs">A D A F#m</span>

I don't need a lover
I need people
Women scare me
Life wasn't meant for that

<span class="tabs">D7 C#m Bm A</span>

Who has time
Who has time for all of that

<span class="tabs">A Bm C#m D7 E7</span>

One day I'll find a lover
We'll sleep in different beds
Split our money
All my expectations met
Sounds perfect
Is that sexist?

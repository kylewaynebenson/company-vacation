###Lyrics

Take the time to write down everything, that you know you cannot do but should: He will take it from you, like he promised that he would. Forget the things that you have feared, and

Watch what  
you will become.  
Oh watch,  
what you will become.  

Joshua, it's you I looked up to, it is you I want to have become: Don't let this cancer slight your stay, remember where you're from. You told me it's a promise from above.

Your bones are brittle, blood bundled up with sick. But your bones are brittle, blood is bundled up. 

It's you who taught me not to only fight
For the causes that I know I'll win
And in life you taught it, with a love and as a friend,
In death I see you're teaching me again.

Life can't be lived inside a cage, I'd die, to see your bones again.

<!-- You're captive to a deadly sickness, and all I can think: can you see from there I am changed? -->

###Lyrics

The light faded from the taller window near
Sitting in the bath for several hours
Reading Fuller to validate my fears
Friends have three kids I hang out in showers

Sedentary but for the thought of real love
I don't plan on following through with biology
Though I meet her weekly in a grocery
By the time we are a thing she isn't right for me

Girl I love you so, but do we have to breed?
Clap your hands with me if you hate biology. 

You’ll never be, what makes me satisfied,
Grey sweats unbrushed hair, completely benign
I understand the position you’re put in
With Beyonce as queen, all sub-standards denied

Sedentary but for love I’ve imagined up 
She makes plans and looks at me lovingly
Though the compromises that I make pale to what she brings
By the time I meet her folks I wish she didn't breathe

Girl I love you so, but do we have to breed?
Clap your hands with me if you hate biology. 
Sure you have eggs but do you need my seed?
Clap your hands with me if you hate technology?

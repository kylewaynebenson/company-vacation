###Lyrics

<span class="tabs">F Cm Fm Cm C</span>

The light faded from the taller window near  
Sitting in the bath for several hours  
Reading Fuller to validate my fears  
Friends have three kids I hang out in showers  

<span class="tabs">C D G Em Cm</span>

Sedentary but for the thought of real love
<span class="tabs">C D G Em Bm</span>
I don't plan on following through with biology 
<span class="tabs">Bm C D</span>
Though I meet her weekly in a grocery
<span class="tabs">Bm C D</span>  
By the time we are a thing she isn't right for me  

<span class="tabs">F C</span>
Girl I love you so, but do we have to breed?  
Clap your hands with me if you hate biology.   

<span class="tabs">F Cm Fm Cm C</span>
You’ll never be, what makes me satisfied,  
Grey sweats unbrushed hair, completely benign  
I understand the position you’re put in  
With Beyonce as queen, all sub-standards denied  

Sedentary but for love I’ve imagined up  
She makes plans and looks at me lovingly  
Though the compromises that I make pale to what she brings  
By the time I meet her folks I wish she didn't breathe  

Girl I love you so, but do we have to breed?  
Clap your hands with me if you hate biology.   
Sure you have eggs but do you need my seed?  
Clap your hands with me if you hate technology?

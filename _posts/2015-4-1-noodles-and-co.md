###Lyrics

<span class="tabs">G Bm C7 D7</span>

Sitting at our booth on the south side,  
we'll make fun of our middle aged waiter.  
Criticizing others is one place we get along.  
Looking down mid-laugh, I see your eggs are  
scrambled and mine over easy.  
Kind of funny that we take our eggs like we take life.  

<span class="tabs">C7 D</span>

Nothing good ever happens  
at Noodles and Company.

<span class="tabs">G Bm C7 D7</span>

Girl I know you like the look of me,  
and I think that you're pretty fine,  
which is why you finally consented to that ring.  
We said to ourselves one day,  
"hey this is the best that I may ever get."  
False dilemma got the best of me.  

<span class="tabs">C7 D</span>

Pray that diamond rings put  
wandering things at peace.  

<span class="tabs">G C7 D7</span>

Ha, Happy, Ha

<span class="tabs">C7 D7</span>

I'll believe it when I see it and not just on the TV set  

<span class="tabs">G Bm C7 D7 Em Bm C7 D7</span>

I sent an email asking for a sit down  
conversation all about the  
mortgage that you said would help you nest.  
Maybe that's too heavy, you're avoiding,  
so let's talk about the surface,  
last year's taxes, healthcare acts, Kanye."  

Once we're full, I'm sure  
that we could be happy.  

Ha, Happy, Ha  
I'll believe it when I see it and I would love to be it.

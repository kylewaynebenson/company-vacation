<h2>title: Who Has Time</h2>

<h3>Lyrics</h3>

<p>Wild fits of depression,
Add that one day to hypertension,
I should take that paid time off</p>

<p>Maybe join a gym,
take up a hobby,
Buy new clothes that fit me right</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need a lover
who has time for that
I don&rsquo;t have feelings
Never can love enough
Who has time
Who has time</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m toward the future
Life always seems to get better,
When you&rsquo;re white and middle class
401k with Match
All my premium&rsquo;s paid
My yoga instructor helps me breath</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need a lover
But I need people
Women scare me
Life wasn&rsquo;t meant for that
Who has time for that
Who has time for that</p>

<p>One day I&rsquo;ll find a lover
We&rsquo;ll sleep in different beds
Split our money
All my expectations met
Sounds perfect
Is that sexist?</p>

###Lyrics

<span class="tabs">C F</span>

On the last night of the Chinese New Year
Had a fist fight with my ex wife, it felt cavalier

Had a fist fight, it felt all right
As a royal Knight, zodiac snake flight

The rabbit, the rabbit, the pig and the rabbit,
The horse, the horse, the horse and the dragon.

On the last night of the Chinese New Year
Had a fist fight with my ex wife, it felt cavalier

<span class="tabs">C Em F G</span>

Had a fist fight, it felt all right
As a royal Knight, zodiac snake flight

The rabbit, the rabbit, the pig and the rabbit,
The horse, the horse, the horse and the dragon.

<!-- The snake is Claire
	The Dragon is Me
	The Rabbit is Mark
	The Pig is Scott
	The horse is Alyssa
	the knight is the part of me who detests myself-->

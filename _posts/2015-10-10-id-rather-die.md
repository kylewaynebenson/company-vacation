###Lyrics


Kelly will you hate us for the things we say after you died?  
I wouldn't put it past you to hold grudges in the afterlife.  
Even though it's you who suffered, I can't help but think about myself and take an inventory of my life.  
Kelly will you hate us after you died?  

After you died  
How hard I cried  
After you died  

Standing there beside your hospital bed  
Watching your mother cry and hold your head  

Before I die  
Let me live life  
Before I die  

I have been a stranger to every tragedy.  
I have always had my needs provided for me.  
I've been reckless and expected that my life stay the same, so suffering comes as a surprise.  
Kelly will you hate us for after you died?  

After you died  
How hard I cried  
After you died  

Does my body have to ache every time I eat?  
The guilt of suffocating in silk sheets.  

I'd rather die  
Than still be alive  
I'd rather die
